# QuinLED-ESP32-Breakout

PCB board for hosting a QuinLED-ESP32-ABE module.

It has the next connections:

- 3 x reed switch
- 4 x led (R4/R5/R6/R7 has no resistor value on the board, because I use brights leds, so I have to test which resistor value I will use)
- 1 x BME280 temperature sensor
- 1 x PIR (with controllable led indicator)
- 1 x 12V input (for the PIR)
